# Pulp
A chaotic two player puzzle game where the maze shifts underneath your very feet!  You and another player have to traverse two deadly mazes. But watch where you step, because when the timer reaches zero, you are teleported into each other's mazes which could mean you could find yourself in a fire pit or inside a wall!.

This game was created the Games++ 2016 game jam in Omaha, Nebraska.  The team was composed of 3 RHO Interactive Entertainment members and two students.

## How to play
* Require two controllers.  Move using the controller d-pads.
* To complete each level you both must be standing on top of the 'Goal' tile.
* When the bar in the middle empties, the mazes are switched, teleporting each player onto the other player's maze.
